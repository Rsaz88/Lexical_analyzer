# Lexical_analyzer
This is a simple lexical analyzer borrowed from Concepts of Programming Languages 11th Edition and edited to recognize the following list of reserved words and return their respective token codes:

for (FOR_CODE, 30),
if (IF_CODE, 31), 
else (ELSE_CODE, 32),
while (WHILE_CODE, 33), 
do (DO_CODE, 34), 
int (INT_CODE, 35),
float (FLOAT_CODE, 36),
switch (SWITCH_CODE, 37)implemented

## The implementation is split into 2 parts as follows :

## Part1 : 
Modify the lexical analyzer from the book (section 4.2) to recognize additional reserved words and return their respective token codes

## Part2 : 
Implement the resulting lexical analyzer from part#1 in Java
